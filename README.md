# Network Traffic Analyzer

The objective of this project is to program a viewer of network traffic flows. A traffic flow refers to the frames exchanged within the framework of a protocol
executed on the initiative of two machines, each identified by a MAC address, an IP address and possibly a port number.
The program takes as input a trace file in text format containing the previously captured bytes over an Ethernet network.
